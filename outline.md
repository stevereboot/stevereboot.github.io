# In-house Coding Workshops

The goal of these workshops is to introduce students to the world of coding, in a fun, exciting environment.  Students will learn the fundamentals of coding by working in teams and completing a series of projects.  Also, students will learn from different room-wide events that will take place every hour.  These events will introduce cutting edge domains in computer science, such as big data and machine learning- with an emphasis on how Bloomberg L.P. uses these fields to provide value to our customers.  Guest speakers, videos, terminal demonstrations will be part of these events.  Finally, student teams will have an opportunity to present their version of the final project, which emphasizes creativity and presentation skills.
